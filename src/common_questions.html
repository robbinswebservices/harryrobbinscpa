                    <div class="label">Why should I hire a CPA?</div>
                    <div class="content">To ensure the proper filing of your income tax return, you will want to enlist
                        the help of a Certified Public
                        Accountant.<br>
                        A study conducted by the American Accounting Association revealed that audit adjustments and
                        penalty assessments were more prevalent on self-prepared tax returns than on those filed by a paid preparer.
                        Furthermore, returns prepared by CPAs are more accurate and less
                        prone to adjustments than those filed by paid preparers.
                        Remember, CPAs specialize in complex tax returns.</div>

                        The CPA can help with payment arrangements and in many cases significantly reduce the amount

                        the Offer-In-Compromise Program.</div>

                        Franchise Tax Board.
                        A CPA has experience dealing with these institutions and can help the taxpayer avoid the
                        pitfalls of
                        self-representation.</div>
