        <h2>Why should I hire a CPA?</h2>
        
        <p>Ensure the proper filing of your income tax return by enlisting the help of a Certified Public Accountant.</p>
        
        <p>A study conducted by the American Accounting Association revealed that audit adjustments and penalty assessments were more prevalent on self-prepared tax returns 
        than on those filed by a paid preparer.  Furthermore, returns prepared by CPAs are more accurate and less prone to adjustments than those filed by paid preparers.
        
        Remember, CPAs specialize in complex tax returns.</p>
        

        <h2>I owe the IRS or State and cannot pay what should I do?</h2>
        <p>If you owe taxes and cannot pay, enlist the services of a CPA. 
        The CPA can help with payment arrangements and in many cases significantly reduce the amount owed through the Offer-In-Compromise Program.</p>

        <h2>I'm forming a new business, what type of entity should I choose, C Corporation, S Corporation, LLC, Partnership or Sole Proprietorship?</h2>
        <p>There are many factors to consider when choosing an entity type. These include tax implications, record keeping requirements and cost. A CPA can guide the client in this important choice.</p>
        
        <h2>I'm being audited, should I engage a CPA?</h2>
        <p>By all means, never try to represent yourself in an audit situation with IRS or Franchise Tax Board. 
        A CPA has experience dealing with these institutions and can help the taxpayer avoid the pitfalls of self-representation.</p>
        
        <h2>Estate Tax Representation</h2>
        <p>The death of a spouse, loved one or relative is a traumatic experience and often results in income tax
        issues outside the normal. A CPA can guide you through the process and ensure the proper returns are filed.</p>
        
        <h2>Dealing with governmental agencies</h2>
        <p>Anyone in business has had to deal with a myriad of governmental agencies on a number of issues. It 
        could be a City, County, EPA, EDD, State Board of Equalization, AQMD, Fire Department and Secretary of
        State.</p>
        
        <p>I have years of experience dealing with all of these agencies and understand how each of these operate and the nuances of their requirements.</p>
